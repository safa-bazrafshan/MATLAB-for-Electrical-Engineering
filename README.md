# MATLAB for Electrical Engineering

Welcome to the MATLAB for Electrical Engineering repository!  
This repository accompanies a complete educational series designed to teach MATLAB from basics to advanced topics, specifically tailored for electrical engineering students.

## About This Repository

Here you will find step-by-step tutorials, examples, and practical exercises covering:

- Basic MATLAB programming: variables, matrices, loops, conditionals, and plotting  
- Electrical engineering concepts: signals, systems, transfer functions, poles and zeros, and system response  
- Practical student projects: circuit analysis, amplifiers, motor control, PID design, and final project implementation  
- Advanced MATLAB features: data handling, file I/O, advanced plotting, GUI development, and project management  
- Hardware integration: connecting MATLAB to Arduino and working with sensor data  

Whether you are a student, researcher, or enthusiast, this repository is designed to guide you from foundational MATLAB skills to applied projects in electrical engineering.
